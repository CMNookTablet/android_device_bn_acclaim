Thought For The Day (A Beautiful Poem)
by Fattire


Puppies playing puppily
Monkeys swinging from a tree,
Fishes swimming in the sea,
Reminding me
Some best things in life...
     are free.

Did you choke your puppy with a collar,
Monkeys, boxed up, wail and holler,
Net those guppies with your trawler?
Cuz see, selling what once was free,
Makes you...
     smaller.
